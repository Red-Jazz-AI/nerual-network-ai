# nerual-network-ai
A simple AI trained to recognize numbers given in a image made using PyTorch
Protoype for future learning on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)

# PyTorch
PyTorch is a fully featured framework for building deep learning models,
which is a type of machine learning that's commonly used in applications like image recognition and language processing.
Written in Python, it's relatively easy for most machine learning developers to learn and use.


# Installation 
* Go to [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and you should see a Installion area, simply choose the settings that fit you best, and use the pip command that is given.
* Then clone this repository or download it.

# Usage
First make sure to train the model

```python

if __name__ == "__main__":
    #Predictions()
    Train()
    #* Pick which one you want to do, usually do train first.

```

make sure for your first time that Train() is run.
After training the model, comment out the Train() and un-comment the predictions.
then simply run main.py
